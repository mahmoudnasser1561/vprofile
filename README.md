# AWS Elastic Beanstalk PaaS Architecture
A production-ready, scalable Platform-as-a-Service architecture design demonstrating AWS best practices for high availability, security, and performance.

## Overview
This is a reference architecture design showcasing a multi-tier web application infrastructure using AWS services. The design emphasizes security and scalability.

## Architecture Components
**Public Layer**
- Route 53: DNS management and traffic routing
- AWS WAF: DDoS protection and request filtering
- CloudFront: Global CDN with SSL/TLS termination
- VPC (Multi-AZ: us-east-1a, us-east-1b)
- 
**Public Subnet:**
- Application Load Balancer (HTTPS traffic distribution)
- NAT Gateway (outbound internet access)

**Private Subnet:**
- Elastic Beanstalk: Auto Scaling Group (2-10 EC2 instances)
- RDS PostgreSQL: Multi-AZ with automated backups
- ElastiCache Redis: Session store and application cache
- Amazon MQ (RabbitMQ): Message broker for async processing

**Supporting Services**
- S3: Static assets and application artifacts (encrypted)
- CloudWatch: Centralized logging and monitoring
- IAM: Least privilege access control

## Security Features
- Encryption at rest (RDS, S3, ElastiCache)
- WAF rules for common attack patterns
- Security groups and Network ACLs
- No hardcoded credentials (IAM roles)

## High Availability
- Multi-AZ deployment across two availability zones
- Auto Scaling with health checks and automatic recovery
- RDS Multi-AZ automatic failover (< 2 minutes)
- Automated daily backups (7-day retention)

**Scaling Strategy**
- Scale out: CPU > 70% for 5 minutes
- Scale in: CPU < 30% for 10 minutes
- Min: 2 instances (one per AZ)
- Max: 10 instances

## Data Flow
- User → Route 53 → WAF → CloudFront
- CloudFront → ALB → EC2 instances
- Application checks Redis cache
- On cache miss, queries RDS
- Async tasks published to Amazon MQ
- Static files served from S3
- All logs/metrics sent to CloudWatch

## Cost Optimization
- CloudFront reduces data transfer costs
- S3 lifecycle policies (archive old logs)
- Auto Scaling reduces capacity during low traffic
- Right-sized instance types based on metrics

## Status
Design Phase: Architecture diagram and documentation. Ready for implementation with Terraform/CloudFormation based on specific requirements.
Estimated Monthly Cost: $800-2000 USD (varies by traffic and instance hours).
